# Live Search Tool - HCI Task A

A responsive, front-end single-page application built to demonstrate core Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles. This tool features a real-time, case-insensitive search filter that dynamically updates a list of 100 items (fruits and vegetables) as the user types.

## ✨ Features

* **High-Tech Dark Mode UI:** A sleek, high-contrast interface designed for minimal eye strain and clear visual hierarchy.
* **Live Dynamic Filtering:** The list updates instantly with each keystroke without requiring a page reload or a submit button.
* **Real-Time Text Highlighting:** Matched substrings glow in bright cyan, drawing the user's eye directly to the relevant search results.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** The application title actively changes to "Searching . . . . . " during input, and a live counter displays the exact number of matching items.

## 🧠 HCI Concepts Applied

This project practically implements several key concepts from HCI theory:
* **Donald Norman's Seven Stages of Action:** Closes the *Gulf of Evaluation* by providing immediate, real-time visual feedback (live counter and dynamic title).
* **Preattentive Processing:** Utilizes bright color highlighting to draw attention to matched search terms before conscious processing occurs.
* **Recognition over Recall:** Prevents the user from needing to remember exact spellings by dynamically revealing matches as they type.
* **Fitts's Law:** Implements a large, easily accessible search input area to minimize the effort required during the *Execution* phase.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, absolute positioning, custom scrollbars, and hover state transitions.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** DOM manipulation, event listeners, and Regular Expressions (RegExp) for case-insensitive string matching and text replacement.
